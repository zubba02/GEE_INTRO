    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine is \"a geospatial processing service\" by Google. The [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) website lists the following purposes of the Earth Engine :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide an interactive platform for geospatial algorithm development at scale\n",
    "- Enable high-impact, data-driven science\n",
    "- Make substantive progress on global challenges that involve large geospatial datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, Google Earth Engine is a cloud service which offers access to large scale geospatial datasets and also provides a platform for manipulation of Geospatial data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Manipulation of geospatial data requires huge computational resource and a specialised skill set to deal with the data. Downloading these large datasets and its processing takes a lot of valuable time and physical resources. Google Earth Engine provides a single platform and a highly simplified work flow to deal with these datasets. A basic computer and an acceptable intenet connection is all which is required to manipulate large datasets, making \"science\" more accesble to all. A [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/10/1509) on the Usage, Trends, and Potential of GEE reports that showed \"that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals.\"     \n",
    "\n",
    "For inspiration, the [Google Earth Engine App](https://www.earthengine.app/) page provides a list of Google Earth Engine Apps. Also the [Github Repository](https://github.com/samapriya/ee-appshot/blob/main/app_urls.json) by [Samapriya Roy](https://twitter.com/samapriyaroy) at PlanetLabs lists nearly 3000 Apps and is growing by the day!

    "For an Introduction JavaScript or JS is commonly described as the language of the Web, with neary all current websites running Javascript.

    "**Dictionaries ee.Dictionary()**\n",
